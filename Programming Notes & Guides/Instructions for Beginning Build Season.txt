1. Make sure you've got WPIlib properly installed in Eclipse
	> for 2017, go to http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13503/l/599679-installing-eclipse-c-java
	> start at "Installing the development plugins - Option 1: Online Install" and go from there
2. Install the NavX and SF2 libraries
	> follow instructions from:
			http://www.pdocs.kauailabs.com/navx-mxp/software/roborio-libraries/java/
					- remember, <HomeDirectory> is a fancy way of saying C:/Users/whateveryourusernameis/
			http://pdocs.kauailabs.com/sf2/software/roborio-libraries/java/
					- where is says to name the variable "navx-mxp", instead name it "sf2-frc", like it shows in the image. I think it's a typo.
3.5: Import the project to Eclipse. Also import the NavX examples if not done already.
3. Install motor controller libraries?
