-What's New for FRC Programmers 2017
	>Functionality with Eclipse Luna, Mars, Neon
	>Some aspects of the code work as expected, but lower-level parts of code broke
	>Old libraries such as NavX simply broke
			*chantillyrobotics.org will eventually post what they believe is wrong with the libraries. Once we update to FRC 2017, unless NavX fixes their stuff, it won't work.
	The Good:
		-Eclipse is still a thing
		-That's it
		-There's nothing else
	The Bad:
		-Many motor controller support removed
		-WPIlib is not properly documented; lower-level features are hidden
	How to Upgrade:
		-Run FRC installer for windows
		-install Eclipse Luna, Mars, or Neon
		-install FRC eclipse plugin
		-Import project into Eclipse
