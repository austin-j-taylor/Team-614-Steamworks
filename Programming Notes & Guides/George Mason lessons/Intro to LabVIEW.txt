-Intro to LabVIEW
	>LabVIEW is a drag-and-drop programming language. It's good for beginners with no prior knowledge of coding.
	>A LabVIEW project is organized into a nested dolls-sort of thing, called "VI"s
	>Begin VI tells the robot what is on the robot
	>Teleop VI when you're driving
	>Autonomous VI when I'm bored (play "When I'm Bored" here)
	>Connections are made by drawing lines between values and operations
		+connect two conditionals to a box that represents an AND operation
		+Color of a triangle on a wire indicates data type
	>Begin VI
		+initializes all added motors
			=to give an object a name, click the object>create>constant
		+Once the robot knows what's on it, add inputs to things
		+Structures (for, while, event, etc.) are boxes that hold the objects that act when true/false/etc.
