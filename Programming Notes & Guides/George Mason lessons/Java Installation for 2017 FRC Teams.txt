-Java Installation for 2017 FRC Teams
	>Mike Anderson (Team 116, Herndon High School) robot_maker12@verizon.net
	>Getting your RoboRIO ready
		+Update the RoboRIO by USB, not Ethernet
		+make sure the RoboRIO has the proper operating system image on it by using the RoboRIO imaging tool
		+deploy the Java 8 JDK to the RoboRIO
	>Some useful info
		+RoboRIO runs Linux. SSH server is available (use Putty on Windows to get to SSH shell)
			=File transfers from IDE use SCP
		+Addressing is through mDNS - roborio-614-FRC.local
		+the web server requires Microsoft Silverlight plug-in (Firefox browser only! )
		+DO NOT delete the admin account, alll program transfers require it
	>The development environment
		+The IDE used is Eclipse Neon.
		+FIRST is only suppporting Windows up to 10, but "libraries and compilers are available for OX/X and Linux"
		+The Java 8 JDK must be installed on your system (the JDK, not just the JRE from http://java.com)
	>Installing the FRC 2017 Update Suite
		+First, remove any old LabVIEW or driver station code. Takes about an hour and a half. sorry.
		+run the update suite installer to install the following (takes about an hour and three quarters. sorry):
			=the RoboRIO imaging tool
			=the latest firmware releases
			=latest driver station and smartDashboard
	>Installing Third-Party libraries
		+FIRST has unbundles libraries for certain motor controllers
		+You'll need to go to the product's website to get the instructions for integrating the libaries into Eclipse
		+Add the libaries and header files to the seach path of your project.
	>Installing Java onto the RoboRIO
		+connect your computer to both the RoboRIO and the internet
		+run java-installer.jar at C:\Users\<username>\wpilib\tools
		+repeat for each RoboRIO
		+DO NOT USE "hardware floating point", get the "software float point" version, or your RoboRIO will die a death worse than being forced to watch JD's anime collection on repeat for eternity
	>Building the Project
		+Eclipose will default to creating the project. CLEAN it first.
		+Set the Team # in Window>Preferences.
		+Once the code is built, select Run As>WPILib Java Deploy
