-The far edge of the Tape parallel from the front face of the Boiler | 52 inches | 4 feet 4 inches | 

-Alliance Wall to far edge of Boiler | Between 0 inches (Alliance Wall) to 26 inches (roughly) / Between 0 inches (Alliance Wall) to 2 feet 2 inches (roughly) |

-When shooting from closest Alliance hopper actuator (aiming east when Alliance wall is on right / aiming west when Alliance wall is on left) | Between 100.8 inches(roughly) to 119 inches(roughly) |

-When shooting from southeast wall (Aiming southeast when Alliance is on right) | Between 142.5 inches and 163.5 inches (very rough since going on measurements from the above statements) | Between 11 feet 10.5 inches and 13 feet 7.5 inches (very rough since going on measurements from above statements) |

-|Conic is subject to change | Equation of arc to shoot from when a net is covering the boiler at an angle (Preferrably from the closest hopper actuator, ex: Net-{ Goal-[] Net-} ) | ({-1}/{30.5})(x+4)(x+3.2)(x-11) (units are in feet) | Conic is subject to change | Local mininum is where the robot is |

-|Conic is subject to change | Equation of arc to shoot when net isn't covering boiler (Preferrably from the key or other places that have the boiler not covered by obstacles, ex: Goal-[] Net-} ) | ({-1}/{90})(x+4)(x+3.2)(x-14) (units are in feet) | Conic is subject to change | Local mininum is where the robot is |

-Height of farthest (biggest) Reflective Tape (Vision Tape) on Boiler | 88 inches | 7 feet 4 inches |
